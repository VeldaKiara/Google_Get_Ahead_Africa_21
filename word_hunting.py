"""
Given a 4X4 grid of letters and a dictionary, find the longest word from the dictionary that can be formed in the grid.


The rules for forming a word are:

Start at any position on the board
Move in any of the up to 8 directions to choose another letter
Repeat
Words must be at least 3 characters long
You cannot reuse a letter in a given position in the same word.
You are given a dictionary, with two helper functions: isWord() to check if a word is valid and isPrefix() to check if a string is a prefix of some valid word.
